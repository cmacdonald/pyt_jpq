# PyTerrier JPQ

This is the PyTerrier plugin for Jointly Optimizing Query Encoder and Product Quantization to Improve Retrieval Performance, known as [JPQ](https://github.com/jingtaozhan/JPQ/)

## Usage

JPQ has three stages: indexing, training and retrieval.

 - In indexing, documents are tokenised and encoded into a FAISS index. PyT_JPQ implements
 the IterDictIndexer-like API

```python
indexer = JPQIndexer(
    CHECKPOINT, 
    "./index",
    num_docs = num_docs)
indexer.index(pt.get_dataset("vaswani").get_corpus_iter())
```

 - During retrieval, a FAISS index can be used to retrieve documents.

```python
ret = JPQRetrieve("./index/", "OPQ96,IVF1,PQ96x8.index", CHECKPOINT)
res = ret.search("chemical")
```
 - During training, that FAISS index is rewritten.

```python
ret.fit(train_topics, train_qrels)
```

## Known Issues

 - training is not yet supported by this plugin. Refer to https://github.com/jingtaozhan/JPQ#training

 - indexing into multiple shards is not yet implemented by this plugin.
